The following jupyter notebook examines a urinary biomarker dataset from Kaggle and a group of RNA-seq datasets from NCBI and uses machine learning models to evaluate detection of PDAC (Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma), the most common type of pancreatic cancer. Then, the models are applied onto the opposite datasets to see if we can draw conclusions about using urinary data as an easier/quicker form of obtaining patient data to still accurately detect PDAC.
